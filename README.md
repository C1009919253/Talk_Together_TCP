# Q&A

What does it mean?

It means that you can communicate with other in the same LAN.

How to use it?

First, make sure you and your friends are in the same LAN. Then one of you run the serve program and set his or her ip and port(you can use any port if it works, I often use 56000). The rest of you run the client program and set the serve's ip and port. Last, you can speak now.

What can I do?

All clients and serve are in a same chat room, it means that what a client speak can be seen by all people. The serve can choose to speak to one client, by set the client's ip and port. The serve also can disconnect any client.

So, what I can do is just speaking some words?

Yes. Image, video, file and so on are in the TODO list. Just give me some time!

On what system can it be used?

In theory, it can work in different system like window or ubuntu as long as it can be compiled by qt. Maybe it can be used in cross-system, but I need more try.

How to connect you?

You can email me. My address :1009919253@qq.com, wsf1009919253@163.com. If you don't mind and you speak Chinese well, please use Chinese.
